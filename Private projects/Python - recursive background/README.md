This project creates a recursive tree which you can customize using sliders and switches.

Run project with /dist/recursive/recursive.exe

Controlls:
-Angle Change: Changes the angle change between each recursive branch
-Length Change: Changes the length change of each recursive branch
-Initial Length: Changes the initial length of the tree
-Max Lines: Changes the amount of max recursive branches
-3 Lines: Toggles between two and tree new branches each recursion
-Random: Randomly changes the length change for each recursive branch after the third
-Initial RGB: Sets the initial RGB values of the tree (0 - 255)
-Change RGB: Sets the RGB change value (-30 - 30)
